My goddaughters (ages 3-8) have all at one point stepped on, knocked it off a table, or tried to sit on it. So far, it has survived.  Because of its adjustable height, I can place it on a table or counter and turn it into a standing work desk.

What I really dislike is that, unlike the other powders that I have used in the past, this one does not come with any sort of measuring instrument. The size of the bottle can accommodate one, so I'm not sure why it isn't included. I also don't like that is can leave a bit of an aftertaste at 1/2 teaspoon, so I had to cut the recommended dosage.

That being said, I've owned the best coffee makers from Braun, Krups, Kitchen Aid, and Breville, all of which made decent coffee.
