1,mDesign Toilet Bowl Brush,0,1,1,5,I bought two of these bowl brushes and am happy with the quality and weight. My old bowl brushes cost me about 3 times as much and was way more flimsy and cheap feeling. This brush and it's holder are far better for way less money. The design fit my modern bathroom design.,
2,Mecraft Coffee Dripper,0,2,1,5,"I generally use a French press or a Keurig. However, for some variety I purchased this product. It looks sleek and the coffee is very good! I wish it was maybe a little bit larger but it can make 4 cups! ",
3,Jachi Garlic Press,0,3,1,5,The press is incredibly sturdy deposit the super low price point. I would say the build quality is heavy and durable. The same tool of lesser quality at Whole Foods is around $20,
4,Jaciya scrunchies,0,4,1,4,My boyfriend bought these for me and I liked them because the designs aren't as bad as some of the other scrunchies at this price point. Still not my favorite designs but they're kind of cute still. The most important thing is they are very light and the material helps because it is slick/soft.,
5,Hiware  Steel Straws,0,5,1,5,The variety of straws allows me to use a Green- Eco friendly straw for my varying sizes of liquid containers. Living in SF it is almost a requirement to use Steel or Paper - and I prefer metal. Solid build quality!,
6,OMIRO Hand Mirror,0,6,1,5,The mirror is much better than the low price would suggest. The large surface area allows me to easily line the back of my neck when shaving. Solid addition to shaving kit.,
7,Jolitac Lemon Squeezer,0,7,1,5,My favorite part about the squeezer is the chrome finish + the ease of which it dispatches juice out of lemons! The chrome finish feels sturdy like it will last.,
8,MATEIN 15 ANDROID CHARGING CABLE,0,8,1,5,The cable is so long I never have to worry about not being able to charge my cellphone reliably. I definitely use less batteries on my Xbox controller now! Tbt to battleries?! Right!?!!,
9,Trader Joes Crunchy Almond Butter,0,9,1,5,"This is the most delicious almond butter I have ever tasted.  There is something about the way that Trader Joes roasts the almonds, then lightly salts the butter.  I always buy the crunchy type.  Have enjoyed this almond butter for the past 3 years, repeat buy.",
10,Certain Dri Antiperspirant deodorant,0,10,1,5,"This is a very strong antiperspirant, as well as deodorant.  If you are like me, and have been forced to discard perfectly good items of clothing due to perspiration smell, this will help.  It helped me.  I apply it 2x/day as instructed, and it has saved my wardrobe.",
11,Daily Ritual Women's Stretch Supima Long-Sleeve Dress,0,11,1,5,"This dress can be dressed up or down.  For everyday wear such as running errands or working (at home in my case).  It is stretchy and soft, does not pull or bind.  If you wear this with a pretty pair of shoes and delightful earrings you will feel decorated and relaxed at the same time. ",
12,Amazon Brand Daily Ritual Women's Jersey 3/4-Sleeve V-Neck T-Shirt Dress,0,12,1,5,"This dress is chic!  And comfortable as well.  I wear it with a pair of white gladiator sandals and pretty earrings and feel dressed.  I can and do wear it everywhere, day or night.  It washes well, but I do not put it in the dryer.  Do not want it to fade or wear out too quickly.",
13,Plus White 5 Minute Whitening Kit,0,13,1,5,"This whitening kit is easy to use and the price is good.  It has not caused me any tooth sensitivity and my teeth are whiter.  Since I drink green tea and coffee every day, I need a whitening kit.  I also love the price!  Just have to be careful not to use it too often, since that might cause thinning of tooth enamel.  I follow directions on the box.",
14,Ziploc Space Bag Vacuum Seal Bags,0,14,1,1,"The only thing I like about this is the variety of sizes. What I dislike about this is that the bags don't stay compressed for very long (most of them started expanding after a day, which makes them useless for storage), they're flimsy (2 tore while being filled with bedding despite me being careful), and they don't even get as compressed/flat as advertised (despite not overfilling them). ",
15,Wireless mouse,0,15,1,5,"I was a bit skeptic because it was so cheap. However, it was worth every penny. It fits the contours of my hand perfectly, and it is sensitive enough that it doesn't irritate my arthritis. I like the side scroll feature that allows me to change windows, in addition, the scroll wheel that allows me to move up and down. I have had to change the batteries once a year.  I have tried to use a wired mouse once since I received this one. It felt so cumbersome and annoying, I drove back home at my first opportunity to pick up this one.",
16,Reading Pillow,0,16,1,5,"This was exactly what I needed.  So much show that I don't use my regular pillows anymore. It majorly helped with my back and neck issues. It also comes in handy when I need a supportive back when I sit on the floor to work on my laptop. I kind of wish the cover was removable so that it is easier to clean, but overall, I am 5 with this pillow.",
17,Laptop table,0,17,1,5,"First, I like that it has 2 built-in fans, and an adjustable/retractable USB cable to connect to my laptop.  It also has a space for my cell phone and drawer for storage. I love that it is made of Bamboo, and is remarkably sturdy.  My goddaughters (ages 3-8) have all at one point stepped on, knocked it off a table, or tried to sit on it. So far, it has survived.  Because of its adjustable height, I can place it on a table or counter and turn it into a standing work desk.  What I dislike is that I can't detach the cover over the fans, making it difficult to clean (not impossible) to clean the fans.  However, they work really well at keeping my laptop from overheating.",
18,Organic Methi (Fenugreek seeds),0,18,1,5,"I love that it is certified organic. I love the aroma when you first open the package. The maple syrup odor is not overwhelming and doesn't seem to linger as it does with the capsules. It makes a delicious tea. When mixed with fennel seeds, it has a settling effect on my stomach and has helped tremendously when sipped post meals. Also, makes a good hair rinse after a mask treatment.",
19,MSM Powder,0,19,1,4,"I ordered this because the powder that I normally buy was out of stock. In addition, this company has a pretty decent reputation, so I felt relatively safe that I wasn't going to get MSM powder mixed with anything else. I really like how quickly this powder dissolves in liquid. I like that is Non-GMO and that it is a vegan product.  What I really dislike is that, unlike the other powders that I have used in the past, this one does not come with any sort of measuring instrument. The size of the bottle can accommodate one, so I'm not sure why it isn't included. I also don't like that is can leave a bit of an aftertaste at 1/2 teaspoon, so I had to cut the recommended dosage. I think this is a decent alternative/ backup to my usual product choose.",
20,AmazonBasics Fade Resistant Cotton Towel Set,0,20,1,2,"I like that it's affordable, that the towels are fairly soft, and that the set includes 2 of everything. I dislike that the threads began unraveling after 3 washes, that the towels shed like crazy, and that the towels take a long time to dry.",
21,Andis Quiet Wall Mounted Hair Dryer,0,21,1,5,"I like that it's easy to mount (only took a few minutes), that it doesn't take up a lot of space, that it's fairly powerful (despite its size), and that it comes with a nightlight attached. The only thing I dislike about it is that it's a bit louder than most hair dryers.",
22,Tom Clancys The Division,0,22,1,4,Graphics of Tom Clancy's The Division is awesome. But game story is not that much impressive. Honestly little boring. I didn't face any glitches during game. ,
23,Serta Perfect Sleeper Standard/Queen Bed Pillows,0,23,1,5,"I like that they're affordable, eco-friendly, soft without being flimsy, stuffed completely (no gaps at all), and hold their shape fairly well (even after over 3 years). The only thing I dislike is that they're a little too narrow--it would be nice if they were just 2 inches wider.",
24,Calpak 20-Inch Carry-On Lightweight Expandable Hardsided Upright Suitcase,0,24,1,5,"I like that it is very compact (can fit in even the tiniest overhead bins), durable, has a long handle, has wheels that roll very smoothly, is surprisingly roomy (used it as only suitcase for a week long trip and I don't pack light), can be compressed and expanded, is aesthetically-pleasing, and is very affordable. The only thing I dislike about it is the combination lock because, despite the instructions, I still can't figure out how to use it; it's also possible that it's just broken. ",
25,Accuteck Digital Postal Scale with AC Adapter,0,25,1,5,"I like that it is very accurate and consistent, compact, easy to read, capable of taring, has a large capacity, and has a mailer holder that can be used to weigh packages that are awkwardly-shaped. There's nothing that I dislike about it.",
26,Etekcity Digital Hanging Luggage Scale,0,26,1,1,"The only thing I like about it is that it's cheap. What I dislike about it is that it's consistently off by at least 4 pounds, it's flimsy (the triangle connecting the body to the the part were the luggage hands bent when measuring luggage significantly under the weight capacity), and that the battery died about a week after I purchased it. ",
27,ORE International 5 Arm Arch Floor Lamp,0,27,1,4,"I like how modern it looks, that the arms are adjustable, that it's dimmable, and that it's sturdy (once the arms are properly positioned, they stay there instead of swinging around and also the base is nice and heavy so the entire thing can't tip over). What I dislike about it is how difficult it was to assemble (the instructions were terrible), that it's at least 6 inches taller than advertised (but luckily I have high ceilings, so this wasn't an issue), and that the base is ugly.",
28,"Technivorm Moccamaster 59462 KBG Coffee Brewer, 40 oz, Black",0,28,1,5,"If you love great coffee, buy this machine. When I say great coffee, I mean the kind of coffee you would expect and get from your favorite local coffee roaster/caf?? or quality coffee shop (think Starbucks or Peet's, NOT the tasteless brown water that Dunkin' Donuts sells).    I've wanted a Moccamaster since I first saw one and tasted the coffee it makes while a college student, way back in the 1980s. Owning one at the time was impractical and unattainable, so I moved on. Over the intervening thirty years, I've always lingered enviously over the store displays whenever I encountered them, but never made the plunge?�?the machine was just too expensive. That being said, I've owned the best coffee makers from Braun, Krups, Kitchen Aid, and Breville, all of which made decent coffee. In fact, the Breville made great coffee, although its cost was dangerously close the the Technivorm's. That machine was the no-longer-available Breville BKC600XL Gourmet Single-Cup Coffee Brewer?�?the only Keurig system coffee maker the brewed hot enough for decent extraction. That machine lasted eight years, but finally shorted out due to perforation of the boiler element because of it's aluminum construction.",

35,Focusrite Scarlett Solo (2nd Gen) USB Audio Interface with Pro Tools Plus Audio-Technica AT2035 Condenser ,0,35,1,5,I love this mic and condenser because it makes my music quality sound so good. I disliked the mic stand because it?�?s not stable ,
36,L'Oreal Paris Infallible Never Fail Eyeliner,0,36,1,5,"This eyeliner is soft, but not so soft that it smears.  It is soft enough never to scratch the eye.  This is important since I use it for tightlining.  The price is good, and this is not surprising since L'Oreal is always fair about price.  Important for us working folk!  I like the color selection too.",
37,Douglas laboratories B complex w/metafolin,0,37,1,5,"I feel so much better when taking a high-strength B complex.  I discovered the magic of taking high-strength B complex 15 years ago, when suffering from fatigue and irritability.  This formula is better than many since it uses a patented methylation process to make sure that all the B vitamins are absorbed.  Since some people cannot absorb some of the Bs correctly, this formula is superior.  ",
38,Source Naturals Serene Science GABA Calm,0,38,1,5,"I like the flavor of these lozenges.  They really do work to make me feel calmer, quickly.  The effect is mild, they do not make me sleepy or lethargic.  Just softer and more relaxed, less likely to become aggravated.  When my adult daughter starts a conversation that I know will aggravate me, I place one of these under my tongue and then just nod my head.  Peace in the valley!",
39,Douglas Laboratories Niacinamide - Vitamin B3 to support cardiovascular health,0,39,1,5,"I have been taking 2 capsules, 5 days a week for almost 2 years.  I started taking this for joint pain, and it worked.  What a relief, I was really starting to avoid moving around due to wandering osteoarthritis pain that came and went all over my body.  I dreaded going on medication for that, heard that the meds would destroy my stomach.  I tried this, and within 2 weeks the pain vanished!  My skin has also gotten much prettier, this nutrient is good for so many things!",
40,Carlson Olive Your Heart Olive Oil and Fish Oil,0,40,1,5,"This blend is ideal for heart health, with a combination of olive oil and fish oil.  The lemon flavor masks the fish taste, which is faint.  I like taking a tablespoon of this each morning from the spoon washed down with my protein shake.  This allows me to start the day with a powerhouse supply of nutrients for brain and body.",
41,Designer Whey Protein Powder,0,41,1,5,"This whey powder is easy to use and tastes delicious.  I have been using this for 10 years.  Occasionally I have been tempted by other brands, and have tried those.  I always come back to Designer Whey.  I like it that they constantly conduct scientific research into how to make the product better, to support health and muscle development.",
42,Starbucks VIA Decaf Italian Coffee,0,42,1,5,"I love the flavor of this coffee.  It has the delicious semi-burnt flavor that is characteristic of Starbucks.  I like the single-serving packets, and it is much less expensive per serving than going to a Starbucks store to be served.  I never want to be without this coffee, and always order ahead.",
43,SoBe Water Variety Pack,0,43,1,5,"I love the flavors from Sobe, particularly the Blood Orange.  When I buy a Sobe, I get to have a treat without the sugar load.  All the flavors taste fresh, a little tart but sweet enough.  The size is good, can sip a 20 ounce all afternoon without worrying about tooth decay.",
44,Better Oats Raw Pure & Simple Organic Bare Instant Multigrain Hot Cereal with Flax,0,44,1,5,"This is the most delicious oatmeal I have ever eaten.  I like the pouches that allow me to quickly make just one serving at a time.  Ground flax seed is included, which adds flavor.  And all the fiber is good for lowering cholesterol!",
45,Chefs Star Professional Grade Stainless Steel Pot and Pan Set,0,45,1,5,"I like that they're durable, that the set includes a variety of sizes, that the set includes cooking utensils, that they're dishwasher safe, that they're oven-safe, that they haven't rusted at all (despite being washed many times over the past 3 years), that there are virtually no scratches yet (even after 3 years of constant use), that all except the frying pans have measurement markings inside, that the set includes a steamer basket and boiler basket (not many sets do), that it can be used on any type of stovetop (including induction), and that they're nicely weighted without being too heavy. The only thing I dislike about this set is that things stick to the pans, but that can be mostly avoided with a few tricks.",
46,Core Kitchen Bottle brush ,0,46,1,5,"For $3 this was a steal from Marshall's. It's 15"" long so it's perfect for cleaning my blender which I use daily.  It's mainly made of a thin plastic but seems pretty sturdy.",
47,J.A. Henckels International Statement Knife Block Set,0,47,1,5,"I like that the blades are incredibly sharp and stay sharp (I've had them for 3 years and haven't had to sharpen them yet), that the blades are stainless steel, that they don't rust (even when I let them air-dry), that the set includes every type of knife I need, and that the knives are fairly lightweight while still being sturdy/durable. The only thing I dislike about this is that the handles aren't very ergonomic; despite this, once you get used to using them, you don't really notice.",
48,Pink lady apples ,0,48,1,4,Pretty good price for these types of apples.  They were crisp yet a little sweet as they made a great addition to my lunch.,
49,CC Boards 3-Piece Nonslip Cutting Boards,0,49,1,5,"I like that there's a variety of sizes, that they're very durable (virtually no cutting marks even after 3 years of heavy use), that they're BPA-free, that it's non-porous so it doesn't absorb smells or anything else (unlike wood cutting boards), that they have built in drip catchers (so I don't make a mess when cutting things with liquid in them), that they're dishwasher safe, that they don't slip and slide on my counter, and that they don't get stained. There's nothing I dislike about this.",
50,Bar Keepers Friend Soft Cleanser Liquid,0,50,1,5,"What I like about it is that it works incredibly well without damaging my stainless steel pots and pans, that it comes with scouring cloths, that it was able to clean years old stains on my stove, and that it can also be used to effectively clean things all over the house (faucets, grout, etc.). What I dislike about it is the smell (it smells more than a bit toxic).",
51,Cole & Mason Oil and Vinegar Mister,0,51,1,2,"I like that it looks nice and is cheap. What I dislike is the size (it's too small), that it's made out of plastic instead of glass, that you have to pump the top before each spray if you want a fine mist, that it regularly clogs, and that the nozzle leaks after each spray (and gets oil all over the bottle).",
52,Home-X - Silicone Basting Brushes,0,52,1,5,"I like that the bristles aren't too stiff, that the brush portion can be removed (which makes cleaning it a lot easier), that nothing really sticks to the bristles or gets stuck in them, that it's dishwasher safe, and that the brush dries very quickly. There's nothing I dislike about it.",
53,Rubbermaid Easy Find Lids Food Storage Containers,0,53,1,5,"I like that the set includes a variety of sizes, that the lids snap into each other (which makes them harder to lose), that it's durable, that it's microwave and dishwasher safe, and that the lids fit very snugly for a tight seal. The only thing I dislike is that there isn't much variety, shape-wise; it would be nice if there were some pieces that were wider/rectangular and shorter.",
54,OXO Good Grips 2-Cup Angled Measuring Cup,0,54,1,4,"I like that the capacity is 2 cups instead of 1 cup, that the measurements can be read from above as well as the side, that it's dishwasher safe, that it has a silicone handle (so it's less slippery), and that it's durable (it has been dropped multiple times and didn't get damaged). What I dislike about it is that the design makes it harder to clean and also that the design makes it harder to mix things directly in the cup.",
55,Sagler Stainless Steel Mixing Bowls Set of 5,0,55,1,5,"I like that the set includes every mixing bowl size I could ever need, that each bowl has a lid (so I don't need to use plastic wrap when refrigerating dough or batter), that it comes with graters that allow me to grate directly into the bowl, that the bowls have silicone bottoms (so they don't slip around), that the bowls are stainless steel, that everything is dishwasher safe, that they're surprising light while still being sturdy and durable, and that nothing has rusted (despite being washed in the dishwasher many times over 3 years). The only thing I dislike about the set is that, because of the silicon bottoms, the bowls aren't ideal for creating a makeshift double boiler (like, for melting chocolate); regardless, I have a separate bowl dedicated to using as a makeshift double boiler, so it doesn't really matter much to me.",
56,Redmon Pop Up Hamper,0,56,1,4,"I like the price, that it's fairly compact but can hold quite a bit, that it can fold into a disk (which made packing it up to move incredibly easy), that it has handles, that it's durable (I've carried it via the handles while it was completely full and they didn't rip off as expected), and that it has a zipper closure (I loathe open hampers). The only thing I dislike about it is that it isn't aesthetically pleasing, but I just keep it in my closet, so it's not a big deal.",
57,Convenience Concepts Designs2Go Multi Level TV Stand,0,57,1,5,"I like that it looks a lot more expensive than it actually was, that it was so easy to assemble (didn't need any tools at all--not even an Allen wrench), that it's very sturdy, that it's the perfect size for my 43"" smart TV, that it has a lot of storage space, and that it's durable (it even survived some bad movers that basically threw some of my belongings around). There is nothing I dislike about it.",
58,Rachael Ray Oven Lovin Non-Stick 5-Piece Bakeware Set,0,58,1,5,"I like that literally nothing seems to stick to the pans (even burnt-on cheese), that it has silicon padding on the handles (which makes it so that the pans are less likely to slip out of my hands), that it doesn't rust (even after almost 3 years of washing it in the dishwasher and by hand), that the nonstick coating hasn't started to peel off (like a few other baking pans I had before), that they're durable (I've banged them against things numerous times and there's zero damage), and that they can withstand high heat. The only thing I dislike about the set is that it doesn't include cupcake pans, which is a pretty basic staple of any bakeware set, so I had to buy them separately.",
59,Motorola Moto G4 Play ,0,59,1,4,"Just bought one for my stepdaughter, and it's nice. Really amazing at how far even bottom of the barrel budget phones have come. Motorola isn't particularly loved these days, but 100 dollars for a phone that works on any major US carrier and isn't an all around dismal experience is a win.",
60,Checkered Chef Stainless Steel French Rolling Pin,0,60,1,1,"The only thing I like about it is that it's longer than most rolling pins, which could really come in handy. What I dislike about it is that it's way too light (so a great deal of pressure needs to be applied to the dough to roll it out), everything sticks to it (no matter how much it or the dough is floured), it rusts when washed in the dishwasher (despite supposedly being dishwasher safe), and it's actually coated aluminum (despite being advertised as stainless steel). ",
61,Sili Bake No Slip Silicone Pastry Mat,0,61,1,5,"I like that it doesn't slide around, that a vast majority of doughs don't stick to it, that it always lays completely flat (even though I roll it up to store it), that it's thicker (and therefore more durable) than many other pastry mats, and that it's easy to clean. The only thing I dislike about it is the size--it's a few inches smaller than most pastry mats, so I can't use it to roll out standard 12-inch pizza dough, but it's still the perfect size for virtually everything else I bake, so it's not a big deal at all.",
62,Etekcity Digital Food Scale,0,62,1,4,"I like the price, that it's lightweight and compact, that it's easy to use, that it's backlit (so it's easy to read), that it can display the weight in multiple units of measurement, that it's durable (I've dropped it a few times and it's still in perfect condition), and that it's accurate. One thing I dislike about it is that has issues measuring very low weights (like spices), but I very very rarely need to do that, so it's not a big deal. The other thing I dislike about it is that it doesn't come with a bowl, so I either have to put the food directly on the scale, or use a separate bowl and just zero out the scale.",
63,"Gideon Flameless LED Candle, Vanilla Scented",0,63,1,5,"I like that the scent is potent without being overbearing and lasts a long time (even after almost 3 years of regular usage), that it's made out of real wax (as opposed to plastic), that it's remote-controlled, that it's aesthetically pleasing (so I can leave it out even when it's not in use), that it's dimmable, and that it can be set on a timer. The only thing I dislike about it is that, before you can use the remote control to control it, you first have to turn it on manually.",
64,BECASO iPhone Compatible Lightning Cable,0,64,1,5,"I like that it's so long (unlike the Apple brand lightning cable), that it's actually compatible with my iPhone like it claims to be, that it's extremely cheap, that it still works like it did when I first got it (unlike my Apple lightning cables that all stopped working properly after less than a year), and that it's durable (there's no damage to the cable even after almost 2 years of heavy usage so I haven't even needed to use the other two yet). I have nothing negative to say about this.",
65,Wall mount fastener ,0,65,1,4,I like how easy they are to install and use. I had my whiteboard calendar up in a matter of minutes.  I think they increased the pricing though as it was almost $6 for a set of three.,
66,Samsung Galaxy J7 ,0,66,1,5,"The battery is still fine, average usage around 10% every one hour. The phone rarely lags. for my first Samsung smartphone, I'm happy with it. But I'll probably go higher next time cause my usage is quite heavy.",
67,Backpack,0,67,1,5,"  Good brand, good color, does not weigh, fair size, wide and durable.",
68,trhoat drop,0,68,1,5,  I always buy them help me a lot and relieve me. Good mark,
69,Hat sun,0,69,1,5,"  They are perfect, they adjust to the size of their head, the color is perfect, they do not give heat and protect from the sun, they can be washed and they remain the same.",
70,Tennis Ball Can,0,70,1,5,"  Good brand, correct ball pressure, sealed product without damage.",
71,"Mellanni 4-Piece Sheet Set, Brushed Microfiber 1800 Bedding",0,71,1,5,"I like that it's incredibly soft, that it's very affordable, that it's durable (it's been washed many times and the color hasn't faded and no holes/tears/rips/pills have formed), that it's thicker than most bed sheets, and that they dry fairly quickly. The only thing I dislike about it is that it's not actual wrinkle-resistant--it doesn't wrinkle any more than most bedsheets, but it also doesn't really wrinkle any less.",
72,Gummy Vites,0,72,1,5,They are absolutely perfect! There are no problems or fights to take vitamins is a fun and children remind me that they should take them!,
73,BLU Advance A5 LTE,0,73,1,4,Worst. Phone. Ever.. Battery life is a joke when using mobile data.,
74,Dress Set,0,74,1,5,"  They adjust very well, the beautiful colors, the girls look beautiful with these dresses, perfect quality.",
75,Thermos,0,75,1,4,"  The quality is good, it is resistant, it keeps the water cold for a long time but I find it annoying the hooks to place on the court edge, it always falls",
76,Thermos,0,75,1,4,"  I like the quality of this brand, it keeps the liquid cold for a long time, but I didn't like the colors very much, they are not very bright and some small pieces are not durable, they break easily",
77,Track Jacket,0,77,1,5,"Totally perfect. It fits very well. Bright colors, good quality. I wash in a washing machine and then dry in a dryer and it looks like new, it does not get damaged or change size.",
78,"PowerBar 30g Protein Shake, 14 oz Bottles",0,78,1,5,"I like that it tastes good, that it's creamy instead of chalky, that it's fairly filling (even good as a meal replacement), that it has more protein than most other protein shakes, that it's relatively low in calorie, and that it only has 2 grams of sugar. The only thing I dislike about it is that it has more sodium than most other protein shakes.",
79,Push Up Lace Bras,0,79,1,5,"  It fits very well, the pretty colors, it feels comfortable, I don't feel movement, good quality fabric",
80,case,0,80,1,3,"  Color well, correct product but it is easily damaged, a couple of days after the purchase is damaged and with a lot of use.",
81,shoes,0,81,1,3,"They fit well, correct size, product in good condition but I think it is not very durable, it looks very light.",
82,Tank Top,0,82,1,5,"  I really liked the color, the price was very good, the quality of Nike is always very good",
83,Wire Whisk,0,83,1,5,"    Learn to pronounce  This is a replacement for my mixer that I love, I think this product is of excellent quality.",
84,Overgrip,0,84,1,3,"  I liked the colors, they are bright and very beautiful, the design is also very beautiful but the overgrip is very smooth, the hand slips.",
85,boots,0,85,1,5,Happy girl! The lights work very well. You can turn them off and on at will. My daughter wants to use them every day. They are comfortable and fit very well. The super tough sole.,
86,MOSISO PU Leather Case Compatible with MacBook Pro 13 Inch with Retina Display ,0,86,1,1,"The only thing I liked about this was the price (although it honestly wasn't even worth even that). What I disliked about it is that it looks incredibly cheap, that it seems to be very poorly-made, that it isn't real leather (although that's not surprising considering the price), that it doesn't actually fit my laptop (it's too large so it kept on bunching up and my laptop kept on slipping out), that it prevented my laptop from closing all the way (which meant that it couldn't go to ""sleep""), and that the clasp doesn't stay closed. It's the only Amazon product I've ever returned.",
87,Backpack,0,67,1,5,"  My happy daughter with her bag full of colors. You can play with the sequins and do not fall, which is a big plus!",
88,Overgrip,0,84,1,5,"  Perfect, fits the racket perfectly, does not sweat, does not slip, does not hurt the hand. The color gets very dirty with daily use.",
89,"Cotton Crew Sock, White/Grey Heather Heel",0,89,1,1,"  They are very small, they did not fit my daughter. I look for the right size and it doesn't fit, the size is for a baby.",
90,Uniform Interlock Polo,0,90,1,4,  It is a bit wide but the fabric is good. The size is correct and the quality very well.,
91,Uniform Short Sleeve Polo,0,91,1,5,"  I loved it so much! The fabric is perfect, it looks great, it is not thick or thin, it is perfect.",
92,Backpack,0,67,1,5,"  Very much, the brand is good. Although the model is a bit big. But nothing bothers.",
93, Reli On glucose test strips,0,93,1,5,  I have always bought this for my father and he is 5 with the product.,
94,Cotton Lightly Cushioned Crew Socks,0,94,1,5,"  I liked the softness, the colors are beautiful and the material good",
95,Tile Mate with Replaceable Battery,0,95,1,5,"I like that it's incredibly easy to set up and use, that it has a large range (150 ft), that it's compatible with my Amazon Echo, that the battery is replaceable (as opposed to the old version, which you had to replace altogether when the battery died), that it actually works exactly as it claims it does, and that I can use my keys to find my phone and use my phone to find my keys (it works so well, I actually purchased a few more to put on other items I regularly misplace). The only thing I dislike about it is that it can now only be ""shared"" with 1 other family member--if you want to share with additional family members, it now costs $3 per month.",
96,Febreze Extra Strength Fabric Refresher,0,96,1,5,"I like that it actually gets rid of most orders (including those from pets), that it doesn't have a very strong smell, that it can be used on both clothes and furniture, and that it doesn't leave any sort of stains or residues. The only thing I dislike about it is that (perhaps due to the design of the bottle) it leaves fabrics very wet and can take hours to dry, no matter how light-handed I am when I spray.",
97,Motorola Moto E5 Play,0,97,1,5,"So far pretty impressed with the signal on my e5 play. Oh, and I loaded up my favorite Foo Fighters song on it and the speakers were pretty damn loud. ",
98,Nature Made Melatonin Tablets,0,98,1,4,"I like that it's cheap, that it's over the counter and doesn't come with a risk of dependency, that the tablets are small and easy to swallow, and that it helps me fall asleep much faster than I could on my own (30 minutes vs 2+ hours). What I dislike about it is that it doesn't actually help me stay asleep and that I have to take 2 or 3 tablets for it to actually work. Also, I've found that when I take 3 tablets, it actually causes me to have nightmares.",
99,Kirkland Aller-Tec Cetirizine HCL Antihistamine Tablets,0,99,1,5,"I like the price (only $17 for a year's supply is insanely thrifty), that it's over the counter, that it actually works for my severe year-round allergies (and better than any other allergy medicine I've ever tried, including the name brand Zyrtec and including prescription medications), and that it effectively treats my mild allergic reactions within an hour (hives and all). The only thing I dislike about it is that it's advertised as lasting for 24 hours, but it actually only works for 12 hours for me, so I have to take it twice a day (which really isn't a big deal). Sill, that's 6 months worth of fantastic and effective allergy medicine for $17.",
100,Duck Brand Bubble Wrap Roll,0,100,1,4,"I like the quality (each bubble is completed inflated and done were popped), the width (12"" was enough to cover most of the items I wanted to wrap), that it had small-sized bubbles (which offers more protection that larger-sized bubbles), that it's perforated every 12 inches (so I didn't need scissors), and that the bubbles remained inflated during my entire inter-state move (so much so that I'm actually saving them for my next move). My only dislike is the price--it's not expensive by any means, but I also used another brand that cost half the price for twice the amount of bubble wrap, and it worked just as well.",
101,Wahl Color Pro Complete Hair Cutting Kit,0,101,1,4,"Honestly the moment I picked it up out of the box I was like ""hell yeah"" - it has weight, it's designed to survive in a barber shop for many years.",
102,Stainless Steel Flatware Silverware Set,0,102,1,4,"I like the price (it was ridiculously cheap), the finish (very shiny and hasn't dulled yet), that there are two spoon sizes and two fork sizes, and that each piece has a good weight to it and doesn't feel flimsy like other cheaper silverware sets. The only thing I dislike about the set so far is the knives: one out of four of the knives have started to rust around the serrated portions of the blades, which isn't supposed to happen with real stainless steel; I'm hoping this isn't a sign of what's to come, but with the price I paid for the set, I'm still very happy with it.",
103,Westinghouse Portable Generator ,0,103,1,5,It was worth the money I paid! I've been pretty happy with westinghouse.  It's run flawlessly for me and it had a good workout ,
104,Sharp 43-Inch 1080p Roku Smart LED TV,0,104,1,5,"I literally like everything about it: it's extremely affordable (especially for a smart tv), it comes pre-loaded with apps that use regularly, it allows me to download any other apps that I want (including apps that have free movies and tv shows), it's very easy to set up and generally user-friendly, the picture is very sharp (I honestly can't tell the difference between it and that of a 4K tv), it has great speakers, it has a responsive remote, it can be controlled via the Roku app (which is helpful for when I lose the remote), it's the perfect size for my master bedroom, and the Roku interface is seamless. I've had it for 3 years now, and it's still working as well as it did when I first purchased it. There isn't a single thing about it that I'd change.",
105,Terro Bug Aerosol Spray,0,105,1,5,"I like the price, the fact that I only have to spray it every 6 weeks (although I can get away with spraying inside ever 8 weeks and outside every 6 weeks), that it canoe used both inside and outside, and that it's very effective; I go months without seeing any bugs of any kind inside my house. The only thing I dislike about it is the smell--it's VERY strong and takes a few hours to fade completely.",
106,Batteries,0,106,1,5,"I like the batteries just fine, and honestly couldn't be more pleased with the company that I bought them from. They were considerably cheaper than other brands were charging for an 8 pack, and the shipping was free and arrived much sooner than was expected. When my first package arrived, my batteries were damaged. I contacted the company to determine if they were safe to use, and after they did a quality control check, determined that they were damaged during shipping. They immediately sent me a replacement pack. Most companies don't understand the value of good customer service, and would have just said: ""sorry, there is not our fault."" I appreciate a company that wants to do right by their customers. It's how you create repeat business. I would recommend both the company and its products.",
107,Wireless Headphones,0,107,1,4,"What I like about this item is that it has an enhanced base, built-in microphone. It connects over Bluetooth. The sound isn't as good as my set of Beats headphones, but it is better than some of the other wireless brands that I have tried. What I dislike about them: The instruction manual is not written in a clear manner, and there is very little information.  The power button isn't clearly marked, and one is supposed to wait for a tone and flashing LED light to turn from red to blue when you first power it on. You can't see the lights unless you are looking into the input jack.  Unlike my other wireless headphones, it doesn't come with an external Bluetooth adapter so that it can be paired with a device (ie laptop/computer that doesn't have an internal Bluetooth antenna). Also, the USB charging cables and auxiliary cord are ridiculously short.  There is also no mention in the manual on charging time and life of headphones between charges.",
108,Tronco 20oz Glass Tumbler,0,108,1,5,"The main appeal of this tumbler is the aesthetic coupled with the price point. The tumbler looks just as good in person as in pictures. Moreover, it has weight to it and doesn?�?t feel ?�?cheap?�?.",
109,"APEX LEGENDS 2,150 COINS",0,109,1,5,"The unique thing about buying Apex coins through Amazon is that you save $5. If you were to buy 2,150 coins in-game, it would cost $19.99. Target also supplies coins but for some reason charges tax ($17.27 total) on this digital product.",
110,Crock-Pot Cook and Carry Portable Manual Slow Cooker,0,110,1,4,"I like the price, size/capacity, and how easy it use to use. I also like that the insert is dishwasher-safe. One thing I dislike is that it's not programmable, so you can't set it to cook for whatever amount of time that you want; instead, you have to use a separate kitchen timer to time it. Another thing I dislike about it is how heavy it is--luckily, as previously stated, the stone insert is dishwasher safe because washing it by hand would be a bit of a hassle.",
111,Neaterize Cube Organizer,0,111,1,5,"I really like how easy it is to assemble and how it comes with fabric cubes (unlike most other cube organizers). Also, I like that it's much sturdier than expected, light enough for me to move on my own, and relatively cheap in price but not in quality. One thing I dislike about it is that there is no backing, so if you remove a fabric cube, you can see the wall the cube organizer is in front of, which really isn't a big deal. The other thing I dislike about it is that it doesn't come with a rubber mallet--this would have been helpful when inserting the poles; I ended up just using my hammer, which, once again, isn't a big deal.",
112,Men's Marijuana Necktie - Pot Leaf Necktie - Marijuana Gift for men - Cannabis Gift - CBD gift,0,112,1,5,"100% Handmade Necktie. Features Navy Blue background with small green pot leaf motif. Slightly narrower than a classic tie, measures 2.75"" wide for a modern look and feel (this is 1/4"" narrower than a standard tie, and wider than most ""skinny ties."" ) Subtle and Professional - makes the perfect gift for anyone in the CBD, Hemp, or Marijuana Industry. Tie is handmade of 100% Microfiber - has a high-end look and feel. Tie features loop on back. Standard length.",
113,Stainless steel tongue cleaner,0,113,1,5,It's cleans my tongue well and water cleans it off. ,
114,Samsung 860 EVO 500GB 2.5 Inch SATA III Internal SSD (MZ-76E500B/AM),0,114,1,5,Price of SSD is decreasing now. That is good for customers. Samsung 860 evo have high speed and affordable price. So bye  bye to Hard disk. ,
115,The Steampunk Tarot ,0,115,1,5,I like the beautiful artwork on the cards and how easy it's to shuffle and handle them. The deck is a delight to use and offers insightful readings and comes with a detailed handbook that delineates the intricate meanings of each card to assist newcomers. I would definitely buy another tarot deck by this author. ,
116,Blender,0,116,1,5,The product is awesome .it is easy to operate it has no complication. It is strong and durable .it does not consume much power.,
117,"Lenovo 17"" lapto ideapad 110",0,117,1,4, It lags when trying to open new tabs or programs not to mention the 99 CPU usage spike at times for no reason at all. I've downloaded antivirus to check if a virus may be the culprit (it wasn't). ,
118,Harney & Sons Dragon Pearl Jasmine Tea,0,118,1,5,"The tea has a delicate floral flavor.  I also like it because it does not stain my teeth as black or green teas tend to do.  I have been purchasing this tea for years, and it is well worth the price.",
119,SuperNail Buffing Cream,0,119,1,5,"It only requires a tiny dab of this cream to give the nails a high shine.  Use with a nail buffer.  I have also noticed that buffing the nails causes them to grow faster and thicker.  It also makes the nail beds pink, which is a pretty effect.",
120,Xbox live,0,120,1,5,I had just tried online for Xbox an had the best time playing some of their games. Even though it?�?s only a month I found there marketplace to be amusing an very full of fun ideas.,
121,Trader Joe's Mexicali salad,0,121,1,3,"For a $5 salad, it had pretty good dressing and overall flavor.  However it was not very filling.  I wouldn't get it again.",
122,"Low-Cut Socks,",0,122,1,5,"The socks are very soft and look great. The material is good, I liked the brand and I am very happy with my purchase!",
123,shoes,0,81,1,5,"  I liked many, they are like average shoes, which makes them very comfortable. They look good with jeanes, pants, skirts and shorts. Combine with everything",
124,shoes,0,81,1,5,"I liked comfort, materials and brand, all are very good. And they look very cute. My daughter loves them, it is never taken away. And best of all you can recharge the lights!",
125,Amazer Shower Curtain,0,125,1,5,"The key defining feature is the thickness of the 10 gauge plastic. The curtain has weight to it and doesn?�?t feel flimsy. Furthermore, the plastic doesn?�?t have that smelly chemical odor. ",
126,Ninja Blender/Food Processor,0,126,1,5,"Firstly, the price is fantastic for what you get: a 48 oz blender, a 40 oz food processor, and a 16 oz food chopper. Secondly, I really like that there's only 1 base for all three things because that means that it takes up a lot less room. Thirdly, all of the components are extremely powerful; for example, the food processor was able to turn pecans to complete dust without me having to soak them first. My only dislike would have to be the size of the chopper--I wish it was as large as the food processor.",
127,GetFit Resistance Bands Set 27322 ,0,127,1,5,"I like that the bands start at 10 pounds and go up to 50, and can be used in any combination up to 150 pounds. Which means that as I progress, I won't have to continue to purchase heavier weights. I also like that it comes with a door anchor which allows me to vary my workouts.",
128,Oral b kids toothbrush ,0,128,1,4,"It cleans teeth well, however it should have a indication when fully charged.",
129,Amplixin hair growth shapmpoo,0,129,1,5,"My wife wanted to get her hair to grow quicker, so i looked online and found this shampoo. It sounded like it would be a good fit so i gave it a shot. Needless to say, we purchase a new bottle every 2 weeks like clockwork. Her hair has grown 6 inches in the short amount of time shes been using it, so she is 5, which in turn makes me happy. Great product, would recommend to anyone",
130,dualshock 4 wireless controller for ps4 blue camo,0,130,1,5,"Very nice, sturdy controller. The color on it is awesome, i love blue and camo, so why not put them together? Ive dropped it several times and never had any issues with it. Perfect controller and just what i needed to get back in the game!",
131,Apple,0,131,1,5,"Retina display with thinner bezels, more powerful Intel Core i5, faster operating memory LPDDR3 2133 MHz, better Intel UHD Graphics 617, greater SSD storage (128GB and 512GB)",
132,Acer Aspire 14 inch laptop,0,132,1,3,"This computer that i bought luckily was for my sons school work. It is a basic laptop, able to connect to wifi and good for him to take notes. There is nothing special about it, it would probably not run any video games or things of that nature. The screen in a washed out type of screen so the resooution isnt very sharp. Decent cheap computer good for school work.",
133,playstation 4,0,133,1,5,"Recently got a new flat screen tv so i decided to finally upgrade to the ps4. The picture quality is amazing from this thing, the games seem like moves that you play through. Most games are in 4K which is fantastic, the ps4 has a 1TB hard drive which is more than enough room for my gaming library. I love this machine, and the price was great too!",
134,Bluetooth speaker,0,134,1,5,"This little speaker packs a ton of sound. Its small so its easily portable anywhere you need to go. Its waterproof and sand proof and impact resistant so its great at the beach, lake, the shower, literally anywhere. I use it all the time and its still pumping out killer sound so its also made to last. I would recommend this speaker to anyone who feels the need for more volume",
135,Video game,0,135,1,5,"I love this game, Its my favorite game thats been released for the call of duty franchise. The updated maps from previous games is awesome and the new maps are pretty great as well. The controls are easy to jump right back in after not playing for awhile, which is paramount. I am very happy with this game",
136,TV stand,0,136,1,4,"I needed a new tv stand for a tv in the kids room, and found this one online. Nothing fancy, does the job well. Glass base, quite sturdy. It was delivered fast, which is what i needed and it was super simple to put together and hang the tv on it.",
137,Flat screen tv,0,137,1,5,"The picture on this tv is great, it looks so surreal and sharp. The 55"" makes it huge so everything just looks amazing. The price I paid for this tv is also pretty good, i was actually surprised when looking for a new flat screen. Very very happy with this purchase",
138,Extension cord,0,138,1,4,"Great extension cord, I needed a long one to run along a wall behind my couch to the other side. The black color makes it hard to see against my dark carpet and baseboards. I'm quite happy with this purchase",
139,Friskies Gravy Swirlers Cat food,0,139,1,5,"This cat food is great for my cat. He was always super picky about what type of food he would eat, and it was really hard to find something that was a match. Finally i ordered this bag off amazon and he loves it. He has so much extra energy now that hes found a food he likes. Love this stuff, and its a great price as well",
140,Sync and charge cable with lighting connector,0,140,1,5,Cheap price. Works great with my Apple iPhone. Transfer data while charging function is great! FCC approved and comes in black or white. Great product at an affordable price!,

143,Frigidaire window air conditioning unit,0,143,1,5,"This window air conditioning unit is great. Our central AC went out and it was getting way too hot inside to be bearable. I finally ordered this unit from amazon and couldn?�?t be happier. It easily cools my living room and bedroom both, which is great. If you?�?re looking for a good window unit, check this Frigidaire out for sure! ",
